\chapter{Ideas}

\section{Toolbox for Interactive Optimization}
\paragraph{Idea:}
  Provide a OpenGL interface to visualize the grid optimization.
\paragraph{Motivation:}
  Would help multi channel developers.
\paragraph{Implementation:}
  Coding is straightforward, but interface design is hard.

\section{Partially Non-Factorized Importance Sampling}
\paragraph{Idea:}
  Allow non-factorized grid optimization in two- or three-dimensional
  subspaces.
\paragraph{Motivation:}
  Handle nastiest subspaces.  Non-factorized approaches are impossible
  in higher than three dimensions (and probably only realistic in two
  dimensions), but there are cases that are best handled by including
  non-factorized optimization in two dimensions.
\paragraph{Implementation:}
  The problem is that the present [[vamp_sample_grid0]] can't
  accomodate this, because other auxiliary information has to be
  collected, but a generalization is straightforward.  Work has to
  start from an extended [[divisions]] module.

\section{Correlated Importance Sampling (?)}
\paragraph{Idea:}
  Is it possible to include \emph{some} correlations in a mainly
  factorized context?
\paragraph{Motivation:}
  Would be nice \ldots
\paragraph{Implementation:}
  First, I have to think about the maths \ldots

\section{Align Coordinate System (i.e.~the grid) with Singularities
  (or the hot region)}
\paragraph{Idea:}
  Solve \texttt{vegas}' nastiest problem by finding the direction(s)
  along which singularities are aligned.
\paragraph{Motivation:}
  Automatically choose proper coordinate system in generator
  generators and separate wild and smooth directions.
\paragraph{Implementation:}
  Diagonalize the covariance matrix~$\mathop{\textrm{cov}}(x_ix_j)$ to
  find better axes.  Caveats:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item damp rotations (rotate only if eigenvalues are spread out
      sufficiently).
    \item be careful about blow up of the integration volume, which is
      $V' = Vd^{d/2}$ in the worst case for hypercubes and can be
      even worse for stretched cubes. (An adaptive grid can help,
      since we will have more smooth directions!) 
  \end{itemize}
  \emph{Maybe} try non-linear transformations as well.

\section{Automagic Multi Channel}
\paragraph{Idea:}
  Find and extract one singularity after the other.
\paragraph{Motivation:}
  Obvious.
\paragraph{Implementation:}
  Either use multiple of \texttt{vegas}' $p(x)$ for importance
  sampling.  Or find hot region(s) and split the integration region
  (\'a la signal/background).
